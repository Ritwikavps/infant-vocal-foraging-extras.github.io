# The dynamics of infant vocal trajectories in acoustic space

This is where all the fun extra material for the `infant vocal foraging' research project is stashed for now. I hope to move all this to a proper website soon, and will make sure the link that took you here will redirect there. 

You can find a sample vocalisation snippets **[here](https://Ritwikavps.github.io/infant-vocal-foraging-extras.github.io/sample-vocalisations)**

For a dynamic visualisation of the infant's trajectory in the acoustic space, go here. 

The first published work from this project can be found here, and the poster based on this work presented at SRCD '23 can be found here.
